# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Project

As a Data Analyst in Accenture’s Social Buzz project simulation, I advised a social media platform with 500 million monthly users to optimize its content strategy. 
Using Excel for data analysis and Python (Matplotlib) for visualizations, I cleaned, modeled, and analyzed seven datasets to uncover engagement trends, delivering a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate findings to the client and stakeholders. My work supported user retention and IPO readiness through data-driven recommendations.

# I followed a five-step process:
1. Data Understanding: Studied content, reactions, and user behavior data models to grasp the business domain.
2. Data Cleaning: Ensured dataset accuracy by addressing inconsistencies.
3. Data Modeling: Merged tables to create a dataset for engagement analysis.
4. Data Analysis: Analyzed trends in Excel to uncover insights.
5. Recommendations: Developed strategies for algorithm adjustments and ad prioritization.

# Key Insights:
* Top Content Categories: Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, Food.
* Peak Engagement Times: 11 PM, 6–9 AM, 4 PM.
* High-Performing Content: Photos outperformed other formats, driving engagement.
